# Guptime Environment Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file serves as an example of the environment variables you can use to
# configure the Guptime application. To use it, you can copy this file to
# a `.env` file in the same directory as the executable and modify the values.
#
# Please note that the application reads these values directly from the
# environment at runtime. If you are not using a tool like `dotenv` that
# automatically loads `.env` files, you will need to export these variables
# manually in your shell (e.g., `export HTTP_PORT=8080`).

# The application environment. Can be "development" or "production".
# In "production" mode, features like the Swagger UI are disabled.
# Default: development
ENVIRONMENT=development

# The file path for the SQLite database.
# Default: ./data.db
DB_PATH=./data.db

# The port for the HTTP server to listen on.
# Default: 8080
HTTP_PORT=8080

# The frequency of monitoring checks. Uses Go's time.Duration format.
# Examples: "30s" for 30 seconds, "10m" for 10 minutes, "1h" for 1 hour.
# Default: 5m
CHECK_INTERVAL=5m

# The number of days to keep monitoring data before it's automatically purged.
# Default: 90
RETENTION_DAYS=90
